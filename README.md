# Code Review: Coursemojo Take-Home (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Summary

This is my response to Coursemojo’s take-home code review task for the Full Stack Engineer position. The project includes an annotated and improved version of the original `tictactoe.py` file.

I approached the task with three lenses:
1. **Functionality** – Ensuring correct and reliable behavior
2. **Style** – Improving readability and Pythonic expression
3. **Expandability** – Structuring the code to support future changes
