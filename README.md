# Code Review: Coursemojo Take-Home (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Summary

This is my response to Coursemojoâ€™s take-home code review task for the Full Stack Engineer position. The project includes an annotated and improved version of the original `tictactoe.py` file.

I approached the task with three lenses:
1. **Functionality** â€“ Ensuring correct and reliable behavior
2. **Style** â€“ Improving readability and Pythonic expression
3. **Expandability** â€“ Structuring the code to support future changes

## AI Usage

I used OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT-4 (gpt-4o model) to assist with:
- Reviewing specific functions for readability and logic
- Suggesting refactors for modularity and clarity
- Identifying edge cases and recommending validation logic

Chat transcript is included in `ai_transcript/chatgpt_review.pdf`.
